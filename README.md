# no-arg-constructors
What mean no-arg constructor in Java?

A no-argument constructor (or no-arg constructor) in Java is a constructor that does not take any parameters. It is used to create an instance of a class and initialize the object without requiring any arguments.

Key Points about No-Arg Constructors:
Default Constructor: If you do not explicitly define any constructor in your class, Java will automatically provide a default no-arg constructor.
Explicit No-Arg Constructor: If you define any constructor with parameters in your class, Java will not provide a default no-arg constructor. You need to explicitly define a no-arg constructor if you want one.
Initialization: No-arg constructors are useful for initializing objects with default values.

By providing a no-arg constructor, you ensure that objects of the class can be instantiated without needing any initial values, which can be useful in various situations such as frameworks that require a no-arg constructor for object creation.
